Change to the directory where you extracted the source code and run:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
make
sudo make install

You may then find the GRUB2 KCModule under "Startup and Shutdown" in System Settings. (You may have to run "kbuildsycoca4" the first time you install in order to appear in System Settings).
You may also launch it using "kcmshell4 kcm_grub2".

Requires KDE >= 4.4
